  <p> Software Design Writing Assignment 1
As humans, we interact with software more than we realize, and it is a fundamental
aspect of living as a human. One example of software that stands out to me and I think is
designed with extreme intricacy and care is a Tesla car. The user-friendly design is key in my
opinion, it’s extremely easy to do basic tasks, such as switching on the air conditioning, whereas
with a lot of gas powered cars it can be difficult trying to find the correct buttons to click.
Another thing I love about the Tesla software is the built-in safety features it contains. Notably,
the feature that lets you know when the air pressure of one of your tires is low, displaying a
warning sign to safely pull over and check for a puncture. The Tesla has one big screen where
you can see all the controls of your car and there’s a built-in map feature to make navigating
easy. Why I think this is so important, even though you can argue a regular car can do all the
same things, is the way the Tesla chooses to display it’s features. It’s extremely easy to use and
very user-friendly, which I think is the reason why it’s fundamentally a better internal software
design than every other car on the market. The minimalistic approach reduces complexity and
frustration, making it more appealing to use and purchase. This shows how important software
design can be, even though it may seem like only the features of a car matter, the way the car
displays it may be even more important. In an era where technology affects every aspect of our
lives, clear and aesthetically appealing software design becomes crucial. It improves usability,
enhances safety, and ultimately shapes how we engage with technology. This makes software
design as important as the functionality itself.</p>
